    The SCA814 has a single character input buffer that can be overflowed if the proper steps are not taken.
    To avoid overflowing the input buffer the user should send a single character at a time and wait for that
    same character to be echoed back by the controller. While not necessary, it is advisable to verify that the
    character received from the controller is the same character sent. Once the character is received the next
    character can be processed.
